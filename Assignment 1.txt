
#1.In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
6 (int)
-87.8 (float)
hello (string)
*,/,-,+ (mathematical operator)


#2.What is the difference between string and variable?

variable is a store of information
string is a type of information you would store in a variable

#3 Describe three different data types.

int: Positive or negative whole numbers (without a fractional part) e.g. -1, 5, 123, 56874.
    
float: Any real number with a floating-point representation in which a fractional component is denoted by a decimal symbol or scientific notation e.g. 2.31, 1.25456

complex number : A number with a real and imaginary component represented as   a+ bi.

boolean : Data with one of two built-in values True or False. Notice that 'T' and 'F' are capital. true and false are not valid booleans and Python will throw an error for them.


#4  What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?>>>>
>>>>
An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value. ... As you can see from the other expressions, an expression can return other types of values as well, such as boolean 


# 5 This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
>>>>

 An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.

    
#6 After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1



#7 What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam '+'spamspam'
'spam'*3


8 Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

The expression causes an error because 100 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other 
strings with the + operator.



#9 . What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
>>>>
The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.



#10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix ?
'I have eaten'+99+'burritos
>>>
The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. 
The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos. ' .
